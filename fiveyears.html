            <h2><b><i>What do I imagine for myself?</i></b></h2>

            <p>In five years, it will be the year 2025. I will be 24 years old. I will have been an alum of Washington and Lee University for only a year. Hopefully by then, the pandemic will be under control and mostly a thing of the past. Hopefully, our government have made significant strides to progress the United States forward. Hopefully, climate change becomes more of a priority. But, of course, I don't know what the world will look in five years. Even on a smaller scale, I don't know what the next five years looks like for me. But, I can try to set some goals, so that I -- at the very least -- have a path, even it twists and turns and goes wonky later down the road. </p>

            <h2>Academic Goals</h2>
            <p><i>The following are the academic goals that I want to keep in mind for the next five years. Although these goals are quite basic, they are worth jotting down because they're still big accomplishments to do and I will genuinely be happy to achieve all of these.</i></p>
            <p>1. Get two communications internship in the entertainment and/or beauty industry, or at an agency. </p>
            <p>2. Graduate with a Strategic Communications major and a double minor in DCI and Chinese!</p>
            <p>3. Get a job after graduating! (Pictured below is a company I would love to work at!) </p>

            <h2>Personal Goals</h2>
            <p><i>Along with academic goals, I want to keep in mind personal goals when thinking about the next five years. I think it's important to have a good balance and remember to continue doing things that make you happy, outside of academics.</i></p>
            <p>1. Play the piano regularly again.</p>
            <p>2. Continue making YouTube videos.</p>

            <p>3. If we're allowed to again, travel to Japan to celebrate graduation.</p>
